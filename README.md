# rainbowFireworks
Just some fun rainbow colored fireworks following mouse movement.

I was experimenting with HTML5 canvas and javascript event listeners. Based on this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvz_axxWG4Y

How to use it:
1. Open the index.html
2. Either move your mouse or click with it to achieve the colorful bursting bubbles or fireworks or whatever you'd call it.
